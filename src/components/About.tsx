          <h4><span class="marked-text ">Hey? You, yes you! Finally, you're here!</span></h4>
          <p class="h5">Congratulations for making it till here! That tells me you're curious, which is a trait I highly value (and probably share!). 
            This is a great opportunity for me to broadcast about myself, how I think and my world-view of the current state of affairs in technology and how I reflect on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like working with, and spend most of my time fiddling with technology. To nurture a holistic understanding of tech and business,
            I keep up-to-date with the latest developments, observing and building upon the rapid progress that's happening each day. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a <span class="marked-text">Ï€-shaped software engineer</span> with deep vertical expertise in Mobile Development, Backend Systems, and AI/ML. 
            My breadth spans embedded systems, full-stack development, and UI/UX design. I've had the chance to work on everything from building 
            vehicle infotainment platforms at Rivian to creating AI-powered speech recognition and generative tools for a gaming startup. 
            Along the way, I've engineered backend solutions using Python and Azure, and developed 
            robust mobile apps in Kotlin and Java that have reached thousands of users.

          <p>The need to have a multi-faceted approach to creating valuable software is something that is becoming extremely necessary.
            This is why I've built a diverse skillset that allows me to attack the problem on all sides and provide a unique value proposition.

          <h4>Beyond Programming: The Art of Software Engineering</h4>
          <p class="h5">For some people, programming is simply a zero-sum algorithm game...</p>
            <p> 
              I beg to differ, I believe that the real skill lies in having a comprehensive vision for how these cogs fit together
              to build a functional and valuable system; which is what Software Engineering truly entails. 
              My deep appreciation for this broader perspective, gained through building complex software, has driven me to cultivate my acumen in this area.
            </p>
            <p>
            My skills as a software engineer are complemented by a clear technological vision to prioritize high impact tasks successfully.
            I believe a crucial aspect of technical expertise is knowing when not to over-engineer solutions, 
            understanding the limitations and avoiding the computational equivalent of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
            </p>
            <p class="h5">I like to evaluate my work on the following principles:</p>
            <ul> 
              <li><span class="marked-text">User First:</span> I always begin by empathizing with the end-user, ensuring every decision is rooted in genuine user needs and real-world challenges.</li>
              <li><span class="marked-text">Elegant Simplicity:</span> I believe that clarity is the foundation of great design; each system should be as straightforward as it is functional.</li>
              <li><span class="marked-text">Scalable Efficiency:</span> My approach centers on maintaining peak performance, with a constant focus on reducing bottlenecks and latency.</li>
            </ul>
