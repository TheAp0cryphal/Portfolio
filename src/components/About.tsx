          <h5 class="mb-3">Congratulations for making it till here! That tells me you're curious, which is a trait I highly value (and probably share!). 
            I feel this a great opportunity for me to broadcast about myself, how I think and my world-view of the current state of affairs in technology and how I reflect on it.

          <p>
            I like working with, and spend most of my time fiddling with computers. To nurture a holistic understanding of technology and business,
            I keep up-to-date with the latest developments, observing the rapid progress that's happening each day.

          <h5>For some people, programming is simply a zero-sum algorithm game...</h5>
          <p> 
            I beg to differ, I believe that the real skill lies in having a comprehensive vision for how these cogs fit together
             to build a functional and valuable system; which is what Software Engineering truly entails. 
             My deep appreciation for this broader perspective, gained through building complex software, has driven me to cultivate my acumen in this area.
          </p>
          <p>
          My skills as a software engineer are complemented by a clear technological vision to prioritize high impact tasks successfully.
          I believe a crucial aspect of technical expertise is knowing when not to over-engineer solutions, 
          understanding the limitations and avoiding the computational equivalent of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
